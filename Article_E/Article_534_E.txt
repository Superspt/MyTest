	With the number of daily new cases remaining low, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government launched a "vaccine bubble" plan on Thursday to ease social distancing control for vaccinated people, with the reopening of bars and nightclubs and the resumption of local group tours.
	By far, about 1.35 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Hong Kong, with 467,600 people fully vaccinated.
