	BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has cautioned against any slackening in epidemic control as a travel boom is expected during the upcoming extended May Day holiday.
	Tourists are urged to follow local COVID-19 containment protocols, such as wearing masks and keeping social distance at public venues.
	May Day, also known as Labor Day, is observed on May 1 in China. The May Day holiday, usually a busy travel period in China, lasts from May 1 to 5 this year.
