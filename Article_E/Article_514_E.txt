	An online platform for facilitating ancestor worship and prayers was launched at the press conference for people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and for the Chinese diaspora around the world.
	To attract investment from businesses in Taiwan and overseas Chinese, a series of business, trade, cultural and tourism promotion activities, including hosting the ancestor worship ceremony, kicked off in Gaoping on April 27, with this combination of activities scheduled to run up until May 31.
	During the promotion campaign, a high-end Traditional Chinese Medicine forum will also be held to promote Chinese medicine and its associated culture.
	Gaoping is the birthplace of the Yan Emperor, a legendary pioneer of ancient Chinese agriculture.
