	Directed by Don Hall and Carlos Lopez Estrada, the film inspired by Southeast Asian culture and set in the fantasy land of Kumundra, follows a young girl who sets off on a perilous journey to find the legendary last dragon to help unite her fractured land and save her divided people from an ancient evil force that threatens them all.
	"Raya and the Last Dragon" features a predominantly Asian American voice cast led by Kelly Marie Tran and Awkwafina. The film is also available on Disney's digital streaming service, Disney+, for an extra 30 dollars to subscribers.
	"Raya and the Last Dragon" has grossed 23.43 million dollars in North America as around 51 percent of all theaters in the region are currently open. As another addition to the box office boost, theaters in Los Angeles, the largest metropolitan movie market in the United States, are reopening this week after the most populous county in the country moved into the red tier, the less restrictive tier of California's four-tier system.
	The film also took in 8 million dollars from overseas markets this weekend, pushing its global total to 71.2 million dollars to date.
	According to the box office data compiled by Maoyan, a Chinese movie-ticketing and film data platform, "Raya and the Last Dragon" has earned more than 113 million yuan (around 17.3 million dollars) on the Chinese mainland to date.

	Directed by Tim Story, the film based on the iconic cartoon characters is an eye-popping blend of classic animation and live action. The cat and mouse battle flares up again when Jerry moves into New York City's finest hotel on the eve of "the wedding of the century," forcing the event's desperate planner to hire Tom to get rid of him.
	Roadside Attractions and Lionsgate's historical drama film "The Courier" opened in the third place with 2.01 million dollars from 1,433 locations this weekend.
	Directed by Dominic Cooke and starring Benedict Cumberbatch, Rachel Brosnahan and Merab Ninidze, the film tells the true story of an unassuming British businessman who helped the UK's MI-6 penetrate the Soviet nuclear program in an effort to provide crucial intelligence needed to prevent a nuclear confrontation and defuse the Cuban Missile Crisis.

	Showing endurance at the box office, Universal and DreamWorks' animated family film "The Croods: A New Age" finished fifth with 620,000 dollars from 1,411 locations in its 17th weekend for a North American total of 55.2 million dollars.
