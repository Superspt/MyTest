	Designed with a double-layer structure, the vessel might have been used centuries ago to ignite a fire beneath its innermost layer while holding water or boiled food within the outermost layer, just like its counterpart at presentâ€” namely, what is now termed today as "hot pot".
	"In this way, the habit of eating hot pot in Sichuan may date back some 3,000 years ago," said a net user, amazed by the long history of Sichuan hot pot.

	Apart from the tripod cooking vessel itself, other pottery artifacts were also discovered at the Sanxingdui Ruins site, including a tall and slender pottery vessel featuring a shallow plate on the top that experts believe was used as a food container.
	Experts explained that the food container may serve as an indication that 3,000 years ago, when dining tables hadn't yet been created in China, people would often sit on the ground while eating, as the vessel's height was perfect for seated diners when sitting at ground level.
